# End-to-End Azure Data Pipeline


## Objective
Demonstrate an end-to-end Azure data engineering pipeline:

- **Ingest** → Landing in Azure Blob Storage using Azure Data Factory  
- **Transform** → Clean, process, and manipulate data in Databricks 
- **Processed Storage** → Store processed datasets in Azure Blob Storage  
- **Data Manipulation** → Additional transformations and Hive tables/views creation in Databricks (as Azure Synapse Analytics was not available to me)  
- **Visualisation** → Create dashboards in Power BI
