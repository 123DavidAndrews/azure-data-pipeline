# End-to-End Azure Data Pipeline

**Objective:** Demonstrate an end-to-end Azure data engineering pipeline: ingest -> landing (Azure Blob Storage) -> transform (Databricks) -> processed (in blob storage) -> manipulate/massage data (databricks as I don't have access to Azure Synapse Analytics) -> visualise (Power BI).
